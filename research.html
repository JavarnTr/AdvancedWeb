						<li><strong>Relevancy -</strong> Keeping your website updated with relevant information will draw in more visitors, since those looking for information regarding more recent events may find your website on the search page.</li>
						<li><strong>Metadata -</strong> The title and description metadata can be used by browsers to return an accurate search request, so users will be able to find your website more easily through search.</li>
						<li><strong>Keywords -</strong> Most users won't come accross your website by searching its name, but rather through a question. By having these questions as keywords, your website will appear whenever anyone searches them.</li>
						<li><strong>Linking -</strong> Referencing your sources will make your website come accross as a more trustworthy and reliable source of information. The links will also act as keywords for bigger media sites.</li>
						<li><strong>Alt Tags/Accessibility -</strong> Having accessibility features such as alt tags will make your website usable to a larger range of people, such as those with disabilities.</li>

					<h3>Factors you should know when chosing a web hosting provider</h3>
					<img src="MEDIA/web-hosting.jpg" alt="HTML5" class="research-images"/>				
				</div>
				<div class="flip-box-back-research">
					<h3>Web Host Provider</h3>
					<ol class="research-text">
						<li><strong>Subscription Period and Pricing -</strong> Some web hosting providers will offer a more long-term deal for a cheaper overall price, which can get you more value depending on your situation. If you're already an already established business wanting to expand to online, the long-term plan could be a better option. But if you're just starting out or experimenting with websites, it would be safest to go with a shorter plan for the time being since it's quite a big commitment to keep your website running for multiple years.</li>
						<li><strong>Server Reliability -</strong> It's extremely important to keep your website running almost all the time since you never know when someone will need to visit it. If your website is often down, you may defer potential visitors from coming back another time which isn't good for SEO. This is why it's important to choose a host provider with reliable servers, so it's always available to your users.</li>
						<li><strong>Features -</strong> Every website is different in terms of what it needs, since there are a lot of different purposes. If your website requires a lot of personal information, then you'll want something with more security. Some have features that all website owners will need, such as good customer support. It's important to make sure your web host meets all the basic needs and the needs specific to your website. <a class="research-text" href="https://www.dreamhost.com/academy/how-to-choose-best-web-hosting/">DreamHost</a>	</li>

					<h3>Performance and Maintenance</h3>
					<ol class="research-text">
						<li>Move the Javascript tag to the bottom of the page so it will load Asynchronously.</li>
						<li>Optimize image sizes, since bigger images will take longer to load.</li>
						<li>Choose a web host provider with higher performance hosting.</li>
						<li>Make sure all of Javascript is in its own file, and all of CSS is in its own file rather than different files for different pages.</li>
						<li>Reduce the number of HTTP requests like fonts, as the requests take up more resources.</li>

				<div class="flip-box-back-research">
					<h3>Web Security</h3>
					<ol class="research-text">
						<li><strong>DOS Attack -</strong> A DOS attack (Denial of Service) is done by flooding the target with requests which takes up all the resources. This can be prevented by using firewalls that are configured to combat these attacks.</li>
						<li><strong>Phising -</strong> A Phising attack is done by decieving a person into downloading a virus, usually through an email link. This can be prevented by studying the email before clicking on any links, looking for mistakes or messaging the sender to validate information.</li>
						<li><strong>Session Hijacking -</strong> When a session is made between a user and the server, an attacker can substitute its IP address for the user's computer to take over control of the session. This can be prevented by encrypting the connection, which can be done using a VPN.</li>
						<li><strong>Brute Force -</strong> A program can be made to try every possible combination for a victim's login details. This can be prevented by setting a very strong and random password, and taking advantage of any "two factor authentication" features that are offered.</li>
						<li><strong>Trojan Horse -</strong> Hiding dangerous programs inside of safe ones. Some anti-virus software can detect a Trojan, but it can also be prevented by the user being aware of what they're downloading. <a class="research-text" href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/types-of-cyber-attacks">fortinet</a></li>
